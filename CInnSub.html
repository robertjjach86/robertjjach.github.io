I added level design and simple art, and created few gameplay mechanics (including combat and 'detective mode'). At the start quest was fairly linear, but i overhauled the system and made it more free-roam, with multiple endings. Whole playthrough should take about 15 to 20 minutes of gameplay.</p>

								<h3>Walkthrough</h3>
								
								<pre><code>
1. At the start talk to the man sitting on a bench.(Optional) Take the note on a signpost.
And test your Sense and Mindread abilities.
2. At the Inn, talk to Betty. Exhaust the dialogue options and start investigation. Use
Sense ability, if you have problems locating the interactable items and people. Check
your journal for updates frequently.
3. (optional) Go into the cellar and Sense for hidden compartment under a plank. take
the plank and reveal the First Effigy hidden there.
4. Talk to the guests and inn workers to get a hold of the situation, and Mindread for
extra info. Explore the inn’s stable and surroundings. You need to get 5 clues, any
order.

5. Clue 1 - Mindread Flynn, the worker. You will know that there was a card game
yesterday evening, and the dead guest won money from everyone.
6. Clue 2 - Examine the body of a guest. His money and dagger are missing. He also
has a pack of marked cards on him.
7. Clue 3 - Examine the lantern in the stable. It was tossed on the ground, not just left.
8. Clue 4 - Examine the rock behind the stable. There is blood on it.
9. Clue 5 - Examine the blood splatter on the field behind the stable. Someone was
wounded, and it was a deep wound.
10. (Optional) Search the pile of burned wood in the stable, uncover the partially Burned
Effigy.
11. Return to Betty. Exhaust dialogue and go into the Forest. (Optional) After finding both
effigies, Betty will give you a task to get rid of the Hermit in the Forest.
12. In the Forest, follow the tracks. At the first crossroad, go either to Hermit or follow the
tracks.
13. If taking the Hermit route, try to open the door and start dialogue. Hermit will give you
a protection symbol afterwards. (Optional) If you get the task to remove Hermit from
the Forest, you can start the fight and kill him. Or you can listen to his story (which
gives you backstory on him and Betty) and spare him. If you end dialogue peacefully,
you can always shoot him in the back afterwards. (Optional) When starting combat,
you will have one chance to side with Hermit. Doing so will start ritual. All these
choices matter for the ending.
14. If taking the tracks route, shortly after you see that tracks split. Foot Tracks go into
the ruins, and blood trails to the right. Following either is viable.
15. If you go after blood, you’ll see a pack of wolves near the body of the first missing
person. Defeat them and examine the body. Exhaust the dialogue options and take
the dagger nearby. You can return to tracks.
16. If you follow the tracks, you’ll arrive at the ruins. If you didn’t visit the Hermit, you’ll
get a prompt that it would be wise to do so. You can ignore it or follow through( see
13).
17. (Optional) If undertaking ritual for the hermit, you will need to destroy protection
symbols around the ruins. Then, going inside, you’ss see bodies of missing people.
18. Tracks go into the ruins. You need to go inside. There, you will meet the remaining
two workers. You can Mindread them for additional information. If you get too close,
dialog will start. This is a point of no return for the quest. You can have few options of
progression here:
19. Option 1: Hermit lives, but wasn’t visited. The conversation will be interrupted by npc,
and then a fight will start. You’ll need to defeat enemies.
20. Option 2: Hermit lives, and he gave you the symbol. The conversation will be
interrupted by npc, and you’ll have the option to save the workers. Then a fight will
start.
21. Option 3: Hermit is dead. The conversation will be interrupted by npc, and then a
fight will start. You’ll need to defeat enemies.
22. Option 4: Hermit is dead, but he gave you the symbol earlier. The conversation will
be interrupted by npc, and you’ll have the option to save the workers. Then a fight will
start.
23. (Optional) Option 5. To complete the ritual, place the Hermit’s effigy on the altar.

24. All of these have an impact on the endings. Regardless, after defeating the last
enemy( or placing the effigy on altar), the firewall will appear and you need to run
away. When you exit the ruins, there will be an explosion that will knock you out.
25. If Hermit lives, he will wake you up, and escort you safely out of the forest.
26. If he is dead, you’ll wake up and leave the forest on your own.
27. Return to Betty and talk with her to end the quest.
28. (optional) talk to the Hermit to end the quest.
