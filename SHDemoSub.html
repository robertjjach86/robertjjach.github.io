								<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XBeKg3GKuy22dqnOaUn40U1DKZOtsIDK?usp=drive_link"><b>Short Horror Demo</b></a> is one of my personal projects. This time I focused on level design and immersion, with environmental puzzles, increasingly claustrophobic space and light scares. I am still working on the level art, but the demo is mechanically playable, from start to finish.

								<h2>Overview</h2>
								
								<p>The player is a new worker at the big construction site, which is taking place in the
late 90s. Near the site, there is an abandoned building on a property with uncertain
rights. Yesterday, the construction company finally bought the property, and now
sends the player to make an architectural survey before the building's scheduled
demolition.
The building, however, is haunted by its late inhabitants, and stalked by something
even worse. After being trapped in, the player needs to find the way out, and survive
the encounter with the cause of all the tenants' deaths. </p>
					
								<h3>Premise</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>I wanted to make a short horror story taking place in an apartment building in
the 50-60s communist style that my grandparents live in, with an obligatory
claustrophobic basement with bomb shelter inside ( as those were commonly
constructed back then).</li>
	<li>Player starts exploring the building from the top, and needs to find a way into the lower floors to escape.</li>
	<li>The ghosts of the tenants not only provide scare opportunities, but are
secretly helping guide the player to the level’s exit.</li>
	<li>The puzzles are mainly traversal based, finding hidden passages, and using
the level’s movable objects to create new paths forward, with also standard
key- and item-hunting.</li>
	<li>The flashlight is limited in use, and the player needs to find batteries scattered
around the level.</li>
	<li>The story is told by notes left by the now dead tenants and environmental
storytelling. For example - furniture used to block exits, increasing the
disarray of the apartments from top to bottom, with the ground floor being
most damaged with destroyed walls and broken furniture in the wake of the
monster.</li>
	<li>The monster reacts to movement and sight, is unkillable and the weapon only
provides a few seconds stun. However, it can be trapped in the bomb shelter
in the basement if the player is perceptive and fast enough. This gives the
player a lot of time to find the exit and some breathing room to think.</li>
	<li>Final confrontation is a frantic chase through the basement, where the
monster breaks through doors, walls and other objects to get to the player.</li>
